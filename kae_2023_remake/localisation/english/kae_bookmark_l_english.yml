 2328_BOOKMARK_LOC:0 "The turn of the 24th century has seen unprecedented change in the global power balance. With the end of the Russo-FCA War, Accelerationist sympathies surged across Piedmont and Europe, eventually reaching the war-torn Reformed Commonwealth Ascendancy in South America. The Free Countries Alliance has disintegrated with the loss of its major power, now a bastion of Accelerationism, alongside Piedmont. The International Vanguard, comprised solely of Accelerationist nations, now seeks to spread its ideology like a virus, and has been successful in regions such as Zapadoslavia and Central Africa. Global powers now seek to restore order and return to the pre-war power balance."
